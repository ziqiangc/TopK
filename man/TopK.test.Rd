\title{TopK exact test (main function)}
\usage{
TopK.test(x, g, Kvals = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 25), method = c("WRS",
  "t.test"), B = 0, alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
  ties.method = c("random", "min", "max", "average"), pval = TRUE,
  ReturnType = "TopK", vrb = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a data matrix containing features as rows and samples as columns.}

\item{g}{a vector or factor object giving the group for the corresponding samples of x.}

\item{Kvals}{a numeric vector indicating how many \code{"K"} we choose.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying which method used in TopK test,
must be one of \code{"WRS"} (default) and \code{"t.test"}. See detail.}

\item{B}{the number of inner permutation, default is "0" for exact test.}

\item{alternative}{a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
must be one of \code{"two.sided"} (default), \code{"greater"} or \code{"less"}.
You can specify just the initial letter.}

\item{ties.method}{a character string specifying how ties are treated, see ‘Details’; can be abbreviated.}

\item{pval}{Only option for permutation test method. If TRUE, the permutation matrix will be populated by p-values from t-test.
If FALSE, the permutation matrix will be directly populated by t statistics (negative absolute value).}

\item{ReturnType}{character(1) specify how to return the results.
Could be \code{"list"}, \code{"vector"} or rich format \code{"TopK"}. See detail.}

\item{vrb}{a logical vector indicating TRUE when show some words while running, FALSE otherwise.}
}
\description{
This function perform TopK exact test on a two group data set (Case-Control study).
The univariate p-values were calculated based on mulitiple choices of test.
